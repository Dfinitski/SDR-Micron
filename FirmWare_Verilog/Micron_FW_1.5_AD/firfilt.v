 Polyphase decimating filter

 Based on firX8R8 by James Ahlstrom, N2ADR,  (C) 2011
 Modified for use with HPSDR and DC spur removed by Phil Harman, VK6(A)PH, (C) 2013, 2016


 This is a decimate by 2 dual bank Polyphase FIR filter. 

 The coefficients are initially generated for a basic CIC compensating FIR designed for  256 TAPs, 0.01dB ripple, 110dB ultimate 
 rejection FIR. The FIR compensates for the passband droop of the preceding CIC filter. The coefficients were 
 calculated using Matlab (see filter_2.m).
 
 The Matlab coefficients are fractional so are converted to 18 bit integers by scalling the largest coefficient
 to  2^17 - 1. 
 
 Note that when designing the basic FIR that it decimates by 2 hence the output bandwith will be 1/4 the design
 sampling rate and the output will be 50% of the input levels. 
 
 The coefficients are then split into two files, one containing the even  coefficients (0 - 254) and the other
 the odd (1 - 255).  Conventionally these would then be used as the coeffients for the two FIRs that comprise the polyhase FIR.
 
 However, doing so would restrict the maximum sampling rate at the FIR output to 768ksps.  In order to double this, each set of
 coefficients is again split into two files. The even coefficients are then (0 - 126) and (128 - 254) and the odd (1 - 127) and 
 (129 - 255).  

 The coefficents are then converted to *.mif files so they can be loaded into a ROM. The files are 
 
 (0 - 126) 		= coefFa.mif
 (128 - 254) 	= coefFb.mif
 (1 - 127)     = coefEa.mif
 (129 - 255)	= coefEb.mif

 The generation of the mif files is done via an Excel spreadsheet (see Coeffficients.xlsx) 
 
 Hence each ROM needs to hold 18 x 64 coefficients.  However, due to the need to pipline the ROM addresses in practice a 
 18 x 128 ROM is used with the values > 64 equal to zero.  
 
 Note that the mif files are passed to each  ROM as a parameter.  This not supported by the Quartus ROM Megafunction the output
 of which needed to be  edited (against Altera's recommendations!) in order to be used.

 The speed increase is obtained by operating the Ea/Fa and Eb/Fb FIRs in paralled.  Hence a new input sample is fed to both a and b FIRs. 
 
 In order that the input data is multipled by the coefficients in the correct sequence the sample fed to Eb and Fb is sent
 to a RAM address that is equal to the Fa and Ea address plus the mumber of taps.  
 
 A (24+24) x 128 RAM is required due to the intial address offset of the Eb and Fb FIRs. 

   
   Each FIR works as follows:
   
    RAM address     0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7   etc
						-----------------------------------------------
						|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     
						|	   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     
						------------------------------------------------
				
    Coeff address    0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7   etc
						-----------------------------------------------
						|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     
						| h0  |  h1 | h2  | h3  | h4  | h5  | h6  | h7    
						------------------------------------------------	
				  
				  
    At reset the ROM and RAM addresses are set to 0 (64 in the case of the Eb/Fb RAM bank)
    The first sample is written to RAM address 0 (64). This cause the sample to be multiplied
    by h0 and accumulated. The RAM address is then decremented and the ROM address incremented.
    The sample in the new RAM address is multiplied by the coefficient from the new ROM address.  
    This process is repeated TAPS times. The code then waits for the next sample to arrive which 
    is written to RAM address + 1. This sample is then multiplied by h0 etc and the process is
    continued TAPS times.
